# MachineLearning_FromScratch
This is a repository for generating statistical modeling approaches from scratch using numpy and pandas. Below is the list of what is/will be included within the repository. Those checked have been completed. All examples will first be created in jupyter notebook following the naming convention FromScratch__MODELNAME. After testing, models will be converted into .py files, and moved into the "ImportFunctions" folder. Users can call in functions from this folder as needed. Models containing a check mark below have been completed. Those with * have been tested and moved into the "ImportFunctions" folder.
