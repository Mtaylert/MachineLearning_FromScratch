# MachineLearning_FromScratch
This is a repository for generating statistical modeling approaches from scratch using numpy and pandas. Below is the list of what is/will be included within the repository. Those checked have been completed. All techniques will be created in jupyter notebook folling the naming convention FromScratch__MODELNAME. After testing, models will be converted into .py files, and moved into the "ImportFunctions" folder. Users can call in functions from this folder. Models containing a check mark below have jupyter notebook examples. Those with a double checks have been tested and moved into the "ImportFunctions" folder.
