# MachineLearning_FromScratch
This is a repository for generating all ML models from scratch using numpy and pandas. The goal is to outline both classifiers and
and regressors for the following models:

- Linear [X]
- Decision Tree [X]
- Random Forest [X]
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosted Trees 
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neightbors
- Markov Chain
